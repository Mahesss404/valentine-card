                    <p>My Dearest Girlfriend,</p>
                    <p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about where I am in life, and I wanted to take a moment to tell
                        you just how much I appreciate everything you’ve done for me—and everything that we have done together.

                        To be honest, when I look at where I am right now, I can’t help but feel like it’s all happening so fast,
                        and I really didn’t expect it to be this way. Life has a funny way of surprising us, doesn’t it?

                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>
                    Your love, encouragement, and the way you always make me feel like everything is going to be okay,
                    even when it seems like everything is moving so fast, means the world to me. <br> <br>

                    I’m grateful for the life we are creating together, and I am so lucky to share this journey with you.
                    Thank you for being you, for being here, and for making my life something I never could have expected, in the best way possible.

                    With all my love and appreciation,

                    ~M
                </p>
                <p>Happy Valentine's Day!</p>
